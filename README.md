## ‚ú® TODO

- [ ] Dark Theme

Unfortunately I couldn't implement the Dark Mode on due to time.

During the 3 hours of the challenge I set aside the first 30 minutes to do the initial setup and look for dashboard inspiration on Dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/22016576-Fitness-Dashboard

During the rest of the time I focused my attention on creating the components and animations. When I realized I had already created too many classes without paying attention to the color schema and the design system.

However, if I had more time I would have implemented Dark Mode by creating variables in the css root and a custom hook to set the ".dark" class to the application body. The hook would be called within a ToogleButton component to turn DarkMode on and off.
